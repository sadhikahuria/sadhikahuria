## License
This project is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE).

I chose the MIT License for my website because it offers the perfect balance of flexibility and protection. It allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute my code with minimal restrictions while ensuring that I still receive credit as the original creator. I wanted my website to be accessible to others who might find it useful or want to build on it without worrying about strict licensing rules. Unlike more restrictive licenses, the MIT License doesn’t force derivative projects to remain open-source, making it a great option for both personal and commercial use. At the same time, it includes a liability disclaimer, which means I’m not responsible if someone encounters issues while using my code. Since this is a personal portfolio, my goal is to encourage collaboration, learning, and potential contributions while keeping things simple and hassle-free.
