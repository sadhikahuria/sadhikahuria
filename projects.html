                    <h3>Capstone Puzzle Painting</h3>
                    <p>A high school capstone project featuring a large painting of a puzzle. Each piece represented a desire, hobby, passion, or goal of mine at that time. The painting depicted my dreams as scattered puzzle pieces, waiting to be solved.</p>

                    <p id="puzzle-desc" class="project-desc hidden">The painting consisted of 10 puzzle pieces, each uniquely designed to represent a part of my identity. It was a deeply personal artistic expression reflecting my aspirations and the journey towards fulfilling them.</p>

                    <h3>Shell Implementation</h3>
                    <p>A custom shell built in a Linux-based environment using low-level C programming. The shell uses functions like fork, exec, and wait to handle processes. Additionally, I implemented internal commands like <code>cd</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>help</code>, and <code>exit</code>, while most commands relied on external execution.</p>

                    <p id="shell-desc" class="project-desc hidden">This shell was compiled using Clang in a Docker container on Windows. Signal handling was implemented to manage interruptions effectively. It was a great learning experience in process control and low-level system programming.</p>
